README file for JADE $Name$ - Example programs.

Some example programs are provided with JADE, to show various
framework features and suggested programming idioms.  To run the
examples, you must set CLASSPATH environment variable to contain the
file jade.jar, jadeTools.jar, Base64.jar and iiop.jar and the current directory ('.').
Then change to 'src' directory and refer to the various example agents
with a fully qualified package name; all example agent classes belong
to subpackages of the 'examples' package: for example, class ComplexBehaviourAgent
in 'behaviours' subdirectory of 'examples' directory must be started 
by the jade/src directory with:

      java jade.Boot -gui a1:examples.behaviours.ComplexBehaviourAgent


Refer to the documentation for a description of the provided examples.
