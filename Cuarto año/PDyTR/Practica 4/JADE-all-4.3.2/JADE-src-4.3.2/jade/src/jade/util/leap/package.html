This package contains a set of classes that provides a replacement
for the Java collection framework that is not supported by J2ME.
This replacement is internally used by JADE and, in general,
users are not encouraged to use these classes, because their
behaviour is not fully-compatible with the java.util classes (e.g. for
the thread-safeness). They have been tested just for the purpose of
replacing the JADE internal usage.
