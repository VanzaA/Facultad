This package contains role behaviours for <em><b>FIPA</b></em>
standard protocols. For every interaction protocol mandated by
<em><b>FIPA</b></em> specifications, two roles can be played by an
agent:
<ol>
<li> <b>Initiator</b> role: the agent contacts one or more other
agents to start up a new conversation, evolving according a specific
interaction protocol.
<li> <b>Responder</b> role: in response to a message received from
some other agent, the agent carries on a new conversation following a
specific interaction protocol.
</ol>
<em><b>JADE</b></em> provides a <code>Behaviour</code> object for each
one of these two protocol roles; these behaviours often are abstract
classes that application programmers must extend in order to provide
application specific code to handle the various protocol steps.
