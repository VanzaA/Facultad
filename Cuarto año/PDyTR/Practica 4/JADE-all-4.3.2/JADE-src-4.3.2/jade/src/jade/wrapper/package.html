Together with the classes jade.core.Profile and jade.core.Runtime 
this package provides support for the JADE in-process interface
that allows external Java applications to use JADE as a kind of library and 
to launch the JADE Runtime from within the application itself. 

The classes of this package wraps the main actors of the JADE platform
and allows to interact with them and, in particular, to control their
life-cycle.

A section of the <a href="../../../programmersguide.pdf">Programmer's Guide</a>
contains a detailed description of the usage of the in-process interface.
