<br>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p> The HTTP MTP is directly included in the JADE distribution and is activated 
  by default on Main Containers. As usual for MTPs it is possible to activate 
  it on peripheral containers too by means of the -mtps option (look at the JADE 
  Administrator's guide for details).</p>
<p>This document describes how to configure it to tune its behaviour according 
  to the application requirements (e.g. performances) and the environment characteristics 
  (e.g. firewalls and proxies). Such configurations can be specified by means of 
  typical JADE command line options in the form <tt>-&lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;</tt> or, 
  in case the <tt>-conf &lt;properties file&gt;</tt> option is used, by means of properties in the form<br>
  <tt>key=value</tt></p> 



<h2>2. Basic Configuration</h2>


In order to speed up performances the HTTP MTP is able to reuse connections instead 
of opening new ones each time a message must be delivered to a remote platform. 
This mechanism is totally compatible with FIPA-compliant platforms that do not 
implement it. We can choose to use keep-alive or close connections from the configuration. 
If we choose to use keep-alive connections but a remote platform, which we want 
to communicate to does not support it, the behaviour of the HTTP MTP will be to 
close connections with that platform after each usage. 
<p> <tt>jade_http_mtp_numKeepAlive=n</tt> </p>

<p> This parameter allows specifying the maximum number of connections that the 
  mtp is allowed to keep. Default value for this parameter is 10. A value of 0 
  means that the connection reusage mechanism is turned off. </p>

<p><tt>jade_http_mtp_timeout=milliseconds</tt> 
<p> The Server part of the HTTP MTP also keeps alive connections from other platforms 
  that are using the connection reusage feature. By setting up this timeout we 
  can set a maximum idle time for these connections in order to improve the memory 
  consumption. Default value for this parameter is 60000 (1 minute). If we want 
  this time to be infinite we must put this value to 0. </p>

<tt>jade_http_mtp_outPort=n</tt>

<p>This parameter allows specifying the local port used by outgoing connections 
  with remote platforms. If this parameter is not specified, a random free port 
  will be used.</p>
<tt>
jade_http_mtp_proxyHost=hostName<br>
jade_http_mtp_proxyPort=portNumber
</tt>
<p>
Setting up these parameters we can use a HTTP Proxy to redirect
the platform outgoing messages. If these parameters are not specified, then
connections will be opened directly to the remote platforms.
</p>

<tt>jade_http_mtp_parser=saxClassName</tt>
<p> The HTTP MTP needs a SAX XML Parser. By means of this parameter it is possible 
  to specify the SAX parser implementation class (fully qualified class name). 
  Such class must be in the classpath. If this parameter is not specified the 
  default SAX parser included in the underlying JDK is used.

<h2>3. HTTPS Support</h2>
<p> This HTTP MTP includes support for HTTPS, that means HTTP over SSL connections. 
  This functionality basically permits having a secure and authenticated channel 
  between platforms using this MTP. </p>
<p> 

How it works ? Basically when a connection is being established
between two platforms, the platform acting as server (receiver), sends
its Certificate to the platform that acts as client (sender). At this
moment, the client side must decide if this certificate is
trusted. Optionally, the server can request the client to be
authenticated. If this occurs, client must send its certificate to the
server and makes also its own trust decision from the received
certificate. At this point, if both parts agree in having a secure
communication (because they trust each other), they exchange a session
key, that will be used to encrypt all data sent through the network.
</p>
<p> What we gain in using HTTPS? We gain in security. Using SSL in
communications we are sure that nobody can spy data sent through the
network. If we are doing trust decisions properly, we are also sure
that messages are sent to the correct platform. If we force client
authentication, we can also assure that platforms sending messages to
our platform are trusted platforms.
<p>
What we loose ? Obviously we loose in performance. HTTPS MTP is
approximately 15% slower than normal HTTP MTP.
</p>

<h2>4. HTTPS Configuration</h2>

<p>HTTPS MTP configuration is not easy as with HTTP MTP. It requires
to understand some basic concepts that will be exposed in the
following lines.</p>

<p>As we said in the previous section using SSL connections implies
using certificates to authenticate platforms. It implies also making
decisions when a certificate from a remote platform is received. All
those things are done automatically by this MTP but we must specify
where this certificates are, and which trust decisions are made when
remote certificates are received.</p>

<h3>4.1 Java keytool</h3>

<p>The first step in order to use HTTPS MTP is creating our platform's
certificate. We can solve this step by using java keytool. This
program is provided with Java SDK and JRE platforms. If we don't have
a certificate signed by a Certification Authority, we can create our
own self-signed certificate by using the following command:</p> <br>
<b>keytool -genkey -alias name -keystore filename</b>
<br>
$ keytool -genkey -alias myplatformname -keystore keyfile<br>
Enter keystore password:  mypassword<br>
What is your first and last name?<br>
  [Unknown]:  Joan Ametller<br>
What is the name of your organizational unit?<br>
  [Unknown]:  CCD <br>
What is the name of your organization?<br>
  [Unknown]:  UAB<br>
What is the name of your City or Locality?<br>
  [Unknown]:  Bellaterra<br>
What is the name of your State or Province?<br>
  [Unknown]:  Barcelona<br>
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?<br>
  [Unknown]:  SP<br>
Is CN=Joan Ametller, OU=CCD, O=UAB, L=Bellaterra, ST=Barcelona, C=SP correct?<br>
  [no]:  yes<br>
<br>
Enter key password for <myplatformname><br>
        (RETURN if same as keystore password):<br>  
<br>
<p>After this step we have a java Keystore (file named
<i>keyfile</i>) that contains our platform's certificate and private
key. This information is protected with the password
<i>mypassword</i>.</p>

<h3>4.2 Key Managers</h3>

<p>The sending of certificates during the handshaking process of the
protocol is done automatically. Key Managers are responsible to locate
the certificate and private key of the platform when are needed by
HTTPS. The default KeyManager searches for keys and certificates
inside a Java Keystore file. There are two mandatory arguments for
default keymanager: location of our platform's Java Keystore file and
password for accessing key material inside this file. The name of the
parameters can be specified from the command line: </p>

<br>
java jade.Boot -jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=keyfile
-jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword <br>

<p> Or putting them inside a jade configuration file</p>

<h3>4.3 Trust Managers</h3>

<p>As we said in the introduction, an HTTPS client must perform some
trust decisions. More precisely, when a server certificate is received
it must be decided weather this certificate is trusted or not. In case the
certificate is not trusted, the connection will be aborted. This trust
decision is done automatically by HTTPS MTP and we provide 3 different
behaviours for performing trust decisions:</p> 

<ol>
  <li><b>No Authentication: </b>When the server's certificate is received, we 
    trust this certificate always without checking it. In other words, we trust 
    all certificates. This behaviour is dangerous from the security point of view 
    (we have no authentication) but it is the easiest behaviour in terms of configuration.</li>
  <br>
  In order to use this kind of behaviour we must set the next configuration parameter:<br>
  <i>jade_mtp_http_https_tustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.NoAuthentication</i><br>
  <br>
  <li><b>Strong Authentication: </b> When the server's certificate is received, 
    we will only trust this certificate if it is signed by one of the official 
    Certification Authorities recognised by Java (VeriSign, Thawte, ...). The 
    list of this Certification authority certificates is inside the file JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts, 
    and can be listed using keytool program (keytool -list -keystore cacerts)</li>
  <br>
  To use Strong authentication we must set the parameter <i>trustManagerClass</i> 
  as follows:<br>
  <i>jade_mtp_http_https_tustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.StrongAuthentication</i><br>
  <br>
  <li><b>Friend List Authentication: </b>This last behaviour uses as parameter, 
    a java keystore containing a list of trusted certificates. When a secure connection 
    is being established and certificates are sent, only certificates that are 
    present inside our list of trusted certificates, or certificates issued by 
    one of this trusted certificates will be accepted. </li>
  <br>
  This last behaviour needs some more parameters than the others listed. We will 
  need to set 3: 
  <ul>
    <li><i>jade_mtp_http_httpstrustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.FriendListAuthentication</i> 
      Indicating that Friend List based behaviour will be used by this MTP</li>
    <li><i>jade_mtp_http_https_friendListFile=trust.ks</i> Indicating the file 
      containing the list of trusted certificates.</li>
    <li><i>jade_mtp_http_https_friendListFilePass=mypassword</i> Indicating the 
      password for the keystore containing the list of trusted certificates.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  How can we create a list of trusted certificates ? Using keytool program. We 
  will explain that through an example. Imagine that Alice has her own Java Keystore 
  with its certificate and private key. Bob wants to create a list of trusted 
  certificates including Alice certificate in it. The steps to create the list 
  must be the next:<br>
  <ol>
    <li> First of all, Alice needs to export its certificate from its Java KeyStore 
      file and give it to Bob. In order to export this certificate Alice must 
      execute the following command:</li>
    <br>
    <b>keytool -export -alias certName -file alice.cer -keystore alicekeystore</b><br>
    This will export Alice certificate to the file alice.cer<br>
    <br>
    <li> Alice gives alice.cer to Bob</li>
    <li> Bob includes certificate of alice in its list of trusted certificates 
      by using the command:</li>
    <br>
    <b>keytool -import -alias alice -file alice.cer -keystore trustedList</b> 
  </ol>
</ol>

<h3>4.4 Client Authentication</h3>
<p>
As we said previously, we can force authentication from the server
side. This means that we are forcing all platforms trying to send
messages to our platform to be authenticated. This issue can help us
to restrict the set of platforms being able to send messages to us. To
enable this feature you only need to set the following parameter:</p><br>
<i>jade_mtp_http_https_needClientAuth=yes</i>

<h3>4.5 Switching on HTTPS</h3> 
<p>
HTTPS MTP is included within the HTTP MTP so it is not really another
MTP. The behaviour of this MTP is working without secure
communications by default. If we want the MTP running with secure
connections, we must initialise it by setting a transport address
beginning with "https". This will be detectedat the
beginning and security connections will be used. Of course, using
security connections implies setting also required configuration
parameters as we said previously.</p>
Example starting HTTP MTP with HTTPS support:
<br><br>
<b>java jade.Boot -mtp jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://machine:port/acc)</b>

<h3>4.6 Configuration Examples</h3>

<p>For all the cases explained here we need platform certificate and
private key. We will suppose that we have created a self signed-certificate
for our platform:</p>
<b>keytool -genkey -alias myplatform -keystore mykeys.ks</b><br> 

<p>After this file is created we will show some jade configuration
files, exploiting all HTTPS MTP different behaviours:</p><br>

<b>1. No Authentication Configuration</b><br><br>
Configuration parameters inside jade.conf file:<br><br>
--------------------------<br>
mtp=jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://myhost:7778/acc)<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=mykeys.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_trustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.NoAuthentication<br>
--------------------------<br><br>
<b>2. Strong Authentication Configuration</b><br><br>
Configuration parameters inside jade.conf file:<br><br>
--------------------------<br>
mtp=jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://myhost:7778/acc)<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=mykeys.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_trustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.StrongAuthentication<br>
--------------------------<br><br>
<b>3. Friend List Authentication Configuration</b><br><br> Remember
that using a configuration based on a Friend List implies creating
a list of trusted certificates (see section 5.3). We will suppose that
we have created this list previously and it is named
<i>friends.ks</i>. The password used to protect this file is
<i>mypassword</i>.<br><br> 
Configuration parameters inside jade.conf
file:<br><br> 
--------------------------<br>
mtp=jade.mtp.http.MessageTransportProtocol(https://myhost:7778/acc)<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStoreFile=mykeys.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_keyStorePass=mypassword<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_trustManagerClass=jade.mtp.http.https.FriendListAuthentication<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_friendListFile=friends.ks<br>
jade_mtp_http_https_friendListPass=mypassword<br>
--------------------------<br><br>

To run this configurations we only need to invoke JADE with this
configuration file:<br><br>
<b>java jade.Boot -conf jade.conf</b><br>
