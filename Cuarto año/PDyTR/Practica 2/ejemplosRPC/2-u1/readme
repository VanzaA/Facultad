This directory contains an RPC based system for looking up remote user names
and uids. The server provides 2 remote procedures:

	byname : given a username it returns the corresponding uid, or -1 if none
	bynum  : given a uid, it returns the corresponding username or "ERROR" if
	         none found.

Files:

userlookup.x: the protocol definition file. 
userlookup_services.c: the code for the remote procedures.
userlookup_client.c: the client main().

The other files are generated by rpcgen (_svc.c, _clnt.c, _xdr.c & .h).

This example shows how to use a string parameter with RPC, in this case the
username is a string with maximum length 10.
