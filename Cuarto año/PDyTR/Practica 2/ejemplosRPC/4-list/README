Example of using a linked list (simply linked). Although this example
is pretty simple, it shows how XDR handles pointers. The most interesting
part of this example is probably the generated code in ll_xdr - the 
xdr filter that encodes/decodes linked lists (uses xdr_pointer)

The linked list is based on record defined as follows (in ll.x):

struct foo {
	int x;
	foo *next;
};

Each record holds an int and a pointer to the next node.

There is a single remote procedure that returns the sum of
the integers in a linked list.

FILES:

ll.x: this is the RPC protocol definition file. 
llclient.c : client code, creates a linked list from the
   command line arguments and passed to the remote procedure
llservice.c : server code, does the summation of ints in the linked list.
	rpcgen -C -Ss generated most of this.
